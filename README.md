# Andela-Nigeria-the-Address-book-final-project-for-ALC-2.0-web-beginners-
Andela Nigeria ALC 2.0 which began in December 2017 , 
i was opportune to partake in the course taught via udacity and supported by google. 
This is a final project termed the address book. I included in this repository my index.html, style.css, design.js. 
My javascript was mainly coded in pure javascript and i used jquerry for only one event which is to toggle(). 
I want to thank andela for the opportunity to learning basic coding, udacity for using their platform to train me, w3school and mozilla development network websites for their great reference materials which aided in my completing this course.


Time to review the codes 15/10/2022
